abstract = {Inverse modelling provides a mathematical framework for constructing a model of physical property distributions in the subsurface that are consistent with the data collected in geophysical surveys. The geosciences are increasingly moving towards the integration of geological, geophysical, and hydrological information to better characterize the subsurface. This integration must span disciplines and is not only challenging scientifically, but additionally the inconsistencies between conventions often makes implementations complicated, non­ reproducible, or inefficient. SimPEG is an open-source, multi-university effort aimed at providing a generalized framework for solving forward and inverse problems. SimPEG includes finite volume discretizations on structured and unstructured meshes, interfaces to standard numerical solver packages, convex optimization algorithms, model parameterizations, and visualization routines. The SimPEG package (http://simpeg.xyz) supports an ecosystem of forward and inverse modelling applications, including electromagnetics, vadose zone flow, seismic, and potential­ fields, that are all written with a common interface and toolbox. The goal of SimPEG is to support a community of researchers with well-tested, extensible tools, and encourage transparency and reproducibility both of the SimPEG software and the geoscientific research it is applied to. In this presentation, we will share some of the lessons we have learned in designing the modular infrastructure, testing and development practices of SimPEG. We will discuss our use of version control, extensive unit-testing, continuous integration, documentation, issue tracking, and resources that facilitate communication between existing team members and allows new researchers to get involved. These practices have enabled the use of SimPEG in research, industry, and education as well as the ability to support a growing number of dependent repositories and applications. We hope that sharing our practices and experiences will help other researchers who are creating communities around their own scientific software. As this session suggests, “software is critical to the success of science,” but, it is the *communities* of researchers that must be supported as we strive to create top quality research tools.},

abstract = {Interest in using electromagnetic methods for reservoir monitoring problems such as hydraulic fracturing, en- hanced oil recovery or carbon-capture and storage is motivating the need to examine the behaviour of electromagnetic fields and fluxes in the presence of steel cased wells. In many of these scenarios, a transmitter is placed on or in the steel cased well. Such a scenario has large physical property contrasts, both in electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability that are atypical of most geologic settings. Using this problem as motivation, we discuss a modular framework for simulating and computing sensitivities for electromagnetic problems. The implementation is a part of SimPEG, an open source package for Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics (Cockett et al., 2015). Two applications of EM simulations and inversions in reservoir monitoring settings are discussed. The first example demonstrates forward simulations on a cylindrically symmetric mesh to interrogate and visualize electromagnetic fields and fluxes in the presence of steel cased wells. The second example demonstrates a sensitivity analysis for a parametric model of a target within a reservoir layer.},

abstract = {Traditionally 4D seismic methods are used to image the flow of an injected fluid within a reservoir for the purpose of enhanced oil recovery or CO2 sequestration. However, this method does not provide direct information about changes in material properties and is typically difficult and expensive to repeat accurately. Since the electrical properties of a porous media depend on saturation, it is possible to use electromagnetic (EM) geophysical methods for time-lapse monitoring as the saturation will change during fluid injection. As a consequence of the ill-posedness of the nonlinear EM inverse problem there is no unique solution, and so other information must be incorporated through regularization in order to recover a reasonable solution. As the changes in electrical conductivity depend on changes in saturation, a two-phase flow simulation is used to compute reference saturation models for the regularization, where Archie's law provides a relation between conductivity and saturation. We find the use of multiphysics to constrain the EM inversion produces model estimates that better represent the physics of the flow.},

abstract = {The process of seawater intrusions into freshwater aquifers occurs naturally, but also as a result of increased groundwater extraction. Different types of models to capture this complex process involving density driven flow and variable boundary conditions have already been proposed and implemented. However, many fewer studies were done in groundwater management planning, for example how to adjust the future groundwater extraction or injection rates with respect to saltwater intrusions occurrence. Geophysical methods (e.g. DC resistivity) offer a good alternative to standard hydrological measurement techniques which need to deal with the miscibility of both freshwater and saltwater and only scarce observation points. The resistivity survey can provide 3D data at lower cost, however the precision depends on the reference models and often decreases with depth. Therefore we suggest an optimization framework which links the hydrogeological model with geophysical datasets. The dynamics of the system is represented by a 3D model for transient groundwater flow in a confined aquifer based on discretized flow and solute mass balance equations. To overcome the difficulty of coupled nonlinear governing equations a semi - Lagrangian method is implemented for the transport equation. This enables to choose arbitrarily large time step without losing stability. For the geophysical forward and inverse problem RESINVM3D package is used. Once the coupled optimization framework is used for many time steps it leads to an optimal control problem. Kalman filtering techniques are often used for such problems, after each time step the optimal state estimates are found based on the system dynamics and observations which are in this case provided by geophysical data. For the variable density flow the process dynamic is nonlinear, in such cases the KF state estimates derivation assumes that the deviation from linearity is of a first order. For the seawater intrusions, where the concentration gradients are small, this assumption is correct.},

abstract = {The MagnetoTelluric (MT) method is widely used in geophysical exploration, especially in geothermal exploration. The extensive frequency range allows mapping the resistivity structure to greater depths than typically achieved using controlled sources (on the order of 10 km's). This is advantageous in identifying structures of interest, such as those related to hydrothermal alterations in a geothermal system and the heat source of the system. To obtain information about subsurface resistivity structures from MT data, an inversion modelling is commonly performed. The goal of an inversion is to recover a resistivity model that explains the data (within a degree of accuracy), given sets of constraints on the model. An attention to detail, often through an iterative process, is required during the inversion. A workflow that is transparent and repeatable is important for addressing the complexities encountered in an inversion and make the iterative process more effective. In this presentation, we will show examples of a workflow for an inversion of MT data from the Krysuvik geothermal area in Iceland. The workflow is implemented as a Python script, where the SimPEG framework (http://simpeg.xyz) is used to implement an open-source code base to work with MT data . The SimPEG framework uses finite-volume discretizations for structured and semi-structured meshes and has built-in routines for optimization and regularization. By structuring and writing the simpegMT code in compliance with the modular, object-oriented framework of SimPEG, full compatibility is achieved and its functions can be leveraged directly. Further, the structure facilitates interoperability with other problem-types, streamlines testing and fosters cooperations between developers and users of the code. We will step through the workflow, where varying complexity leads to a recovery of 3D models of different detail. We show how we guide steps in the workflow based on the preceding results, iteratively building our knowledge and incorporating it to converge to an improved resulting resistivity model. We will discuss the issues that arise and choices made in the workflow, interpret our resistivity model in terms of relevant structures and visualize along with other data sources from the area.},

abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is widely used in research of earthquake source parameters, however, the method is only taught in a handful of university campuses across the country. This reflects, we believe, a lack of accessibility to software and data for nonspecialists. Here we present a web-based interactive tool for comparing real InSAR data from earthquakes with simple elastic models, designed with accessibility in mind. This tool is intended for use in education and outreach settings, and may also facilitate the sharing and interpretation of data following significant earthquakes, thus potentially playing a useful role in earthquake response. The tool, named ‘Visible Earthquakes', uses web-based technologies to instantly render the displacement field that would be observable using InSAR for a given fault location, geometry, orientation, and slip. The user can adjust these source parameters using a simple graphical interface and see how these affect the resulting model interferogram. By visually matching the model interferogram to a real earthquake interferogram, users can produce their own estimates of the earthquake's source parameters. The difference between the observational data and the user's modeled data is calculated and shown to the user to help assess how well the proposed model fits the data. Once satisfied with the fit of their models, users submit their results and see how they compare with the distribution of all other contributed earthquake models. All the data produced by people using the tool is shown to the user once they have modeled a certain earthquake. This includes the modeled earthquake parameters, as well as metadata such as time taken and the modeler's confidence in their results. The spread of different results for each individual earthquake allows the teaching of concepts such as model uncertainty and non-uniqueness when modeling real scientific data. In addition to familiarizing students and the public with InSAR and elastic deformation modeling, Visible Earthquakes enables participation in scientific modeling and classification of real earthquake data.},

abstract = {Inverse modeling is a powerful tool for extracting information about the subsurface from geophysical data. Geophysical inverse problems are inherently multidisciplinary, requiring elements from the relevant physics, numerical simulation, and optimization, as well as knowledge of the geologic setting, and a comprehension of the interplay between all of these elements. The development and advancement of inversion methodologies can be enabled by a framework that supports experimentation, is flexible and extensible, and allows the knowledge generated to be captured and shared. The goal of this paper is to propose a framework that supports many different types of geophysical forward simulations and deterministic inverse problems. Additionally, we provide an open source implementation of this framework in Python called SimPEG (Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics, http://simpeg.xyz). Included in SimPEG are staggered grid, mimetic finite volume discretizations on a number of structured and semi-structured meshes, convex optimization programs, inversion routines, model parameterizations, useful utility codes, and interfaces to standard numerical solver packages. The framework and implementation are modular, allowing the user to explore, experiment with, and iterate over a variety of approaches to the inverse problem. SimPEG provides an extensible, documented, and well-tested framework for inverting many types of geophysical data and thereby helping to answer questions in geoscience applications.

abstract = {Characterizing groundwater flow in the vadose zone has many important and practical applications in near surface hydrogeology. The spatial estimation of the hydraulic conductivity function, which is the regulator of unsaturated groundwater flow, is an critical step in any hydrogeologic site characterization. However, this estimation is difficult and simplifications are consistently used to avert these conceptual and computational difficulties. Comprehensive time­lapse data of in situ saturations, or proxies of saturation from geophysical methods, are increasingly available. Using these large data sets appropriately, and maximizing the utility of the data to recover estimates of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity, requires innovative numerical methods. This inverse problem has been approached in many different ways in the literature from stochastic methods to various gradient based methods. However, the way in which the computational complexity of the inverse method scales becomes important as problem size increases; as computational memory and time often become the bottleneck of solving the inverse problem when the problem is solved for heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity in two­ and particularly in three­dimensions. For the inverse problem involving Richards equation, some version of a Gauss­Newton method (e.g. Levenberg­Marquardt) with a direct calculation of the sensitivity matrix is commonly ￼￼ used. However, while these approaches allow to deal with moderate scale problems they have one major drawback: the sensitivity matrix is a large dense matrix and its computation requires dense linear algebra and, for large scale problems, a non­trivial amount of storage. Furthermore, previous work use either numerical or automatic differentiation in order to compute the sensitivity matrix and this can generate inaccuracies in its computation and tarry convergence of the optimization algorithm. We suggest a modern numerical method that allows for the solution of the inverse problem without explicit computation of the sensitivity matrix and by using exact derivatives of the discrete formulation. Our algorithm is based on the discretize then optimize approach, which discretizes the forward problem first and then uses a discrete optimization algorithm to solve the inverse problem. For the discretization of the forward problem we use an implicit Euler method in time and finite volume in space. Given the discrete form we show that we can analytically compute the derivatives of the forward problem with respect to the (discrete) hydraulic conductivity and, as a result, obtain an implicit formula for the sensitivity. The formula involves the solution of a time dependent problem and therefore we avoid computation and storage of the sensitivities directly and rather suggest a method to efficiently compute the product of a sensitivity times a vector. Equipped with this machinery we are able to use an inexact Gauss­Newton method for the solution of the inverse problem for large scale problems in three­dimensions. Efficient methods that allow for large scale heterogeneous estimation of hydrogeologic parameters are crucial as the community moves towards data­driven models and integrated geophysics.},

abstract = {Simulations and inversions of geophysical electromagnetic data are paramount for discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data. Depending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be classified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and sometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on what one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts for may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric representation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these permutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical implementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the sensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions. This paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic simulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We take an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the necessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical properties, sources, definition of the discrete problem to be solved, the resulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the electromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part of the open source simulation and parameter estimation project SimPEG (http://simpeg.xyz). The application of the framework is demonstrated through two synthetic examples. The first example shows the application of the common framework for 1D time domain and frequency domain inversions. The second example demonstrates how the modular implementation is used to compute the sensitivity for a parametric model where a transmitter is positioned inside a steel cased well.},

A newly developed program, Visible Geology, allows for students to be introduced to many geologic concepts and spatial skills in a virtual environment. Visible Geology is a web-based, three-dimensional environment where students can create and interrogate their own geologic block models. The program begins with a blank model, users then add geologic beds (with custom thickness and color) and can add geologic deformation events like tilting, folding, and faulting. Additionally, simple intrusive dikes can be modelled, as well as unconformities. Students can also explore the interaction of geology with topography by drawing elevation contours to produce their own topographic models. Students can not only spatially manipulate their model, but can create cross-sections and boreholes to practice their visual penetrative abilities. Visible Geology is easy to access and use, with no downloads required, so it can be incorporated into current, paper-based, lab activities. Sample learning activities are being developed that target introductory and structural geology curricula with learning objectives such as relative geologic history, fault characterization, apparent dip and thickness, interference folding, and stereonet interpretation. Visible Geology provides a richly interactive, and immersive environment for students to explore geologic concepts and practice their spatial skills.; Screenshot of Visible Geology showing folding and faulting interactions on a ridge topography.},

abstract = {Inversion of airborne electromagnetic data is often an iterative process, not only requiring that the researcher be able to explore the impact of changing components, such as the choice of regularisation functional or model parameterisation, but also often requiring that forward simulations be run and fields and fluxes visualised in order to build an understanding of the physical processes governing what we observe in the data. In the hope of facilitating this exploration and promoting the reproducibility of geophysical simulations and inversions, we have developed the open-source software package SimPEG. The software has been designed to be modular and extensible, with the goal of allowing researchers to interrogate all of the components and to facilitate the exploration of new inversion strategies. We present an overview of the software in its application to airborne electromagnetics and demonstrate its use for visualising fields and fluxes in a forward simulation, as well as its flexibility in formulating and solving the inverse problem. We invert a line of airborne time-domain electromagnetic data over a conductive vertical plate using a 1D voxel inversion, a 2D voxel inversion and a parametric inversion, where all of the forward modelling is done on a 3D grid. The results in this paper can be reproduced using the provided Jupyter notebooks. The Python software can also be modified to allow users to experiment with parameters and explore the physics of the electromagnetics and intricacies of inversion.},

abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) methods are used to characterize the electrical conductivity distribution of the earth. Since EM methods consider time-varying fields, we typically treat EM in either the frequency domain (FD) or the time domain (TD). Recently, due in part to computational advances, EM geophysical surveys are increasingly being simulated and inverted in 3D. However, the availability of computational resources does not invalidate the use of lower dimensional formulations and methods, which can be useful depending on the geological complexity as well as the survey geometry. For example, we can treat the measured EM data either in TD or FD, and a progressive procedure can be used to invert these data, starting with 1D inversions, then moving to multi-dimensional inversions. As such, we require a set of tools that allow a geophysicists to easily move between dimensions and formulations of the EM problem. This is the motivation behind the open source software package SimPEG-EM which is part of a software ecosystem for Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics (SimPEG). In this presentation, we will share examples as well as our experience from creating a range of simulation and inversion tools for EM methods that span dimensions (1D, 2.5D and 3D) and apply analytic, FD and TD formulations in a consistent framework. The flexibility and consistency in our EM package allows us to be methodical so that we have the capacity to tackle a spectrum of problems in EM geophysics.},

Our aim is to provide the students with resources to build intuition about geophysical techniques, promote curiosity driven exploration, and help them develop the skills necessary to communicate across disciplines. Using open-source resources and our existing research code, we have built modules around simulations, with supporting content to give student interactive tools for exploration into the impacts of input parameters and visualization of the resulting fields, fluxes and data for a variety of problems in applied geophysics, including magnetics, seismic, electromagnetics, and direct current resistivity. The content provides context for the problems, along with exercises that are aimed at getting students to experiment and ask ‘what if...?' questions. In this presentation, we will discuss our approach for designing the structure of the simulation-based modules, the resources we have used, challenges we have encountered, general feedback from students and instructors, as well as our goals and roadmap for future improvement.

abstract = {Using software to address scientific challenges often begins by creating a “whiteboard sketch” that connects terminology and concepts in order to address the question at hand. The next step is the implementation, which generally requires the researcher to adopt a change in terminology and sometimes even a change in mindset to work towards a realization. This disconnect between terminology and code causes delays between ideation and the implementation that is necessary to produce numerical feedback to explore those ideas. In geophysics, we increasingly require integration of multiple disciplines. The lack of technical and linguistic interoperability between these disciplines creates another barrier, which complicates our implementations and often compromises the reproducibility of our methodologies and results. Our response to these challenges has been to use the terminology of geophysics and inverse theory to drive our decisions in framework development, the layout of modules, and user interactions in SimPEG (Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics, http://simpeg.xyz). As a result of this investment in framework design, we have experienced increased consistency between the discussion of theory and its implementation in Python, which has created a platform for rapid curation of ideas. We have also found that having these disciplines in the same framework has not only eased the integration of information between them, but also promoted communication between researchers. In this talk, we will describe the iterative process that we have used to develop our framework using examples from a number of geophysical applications.},

abstract = {InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) is a technique for measuring the deformation of the ground using satellite radar data. One of the principal applications of this method is in the study of earthquakes; in the past 20 years over 70 earthquakes have been studied in this way, and forthcoming satellite missions promise to enable the routine and timely study of events in the future. Despite the utility of the technique and its widespread adoption by the research community, InSAR does not feature in the teaching curricula of most university geoscience departments. This is, we believe, due to a lack of accessibility to software and data. Existing tools for the visualization and modeling of interferograms are often research-oriented, command line-based and/or prohibitively expensive. Here we present a new web-based interactive tool for comparing real InSAR data with simple elastic models. The overall design of this tool was focused on ease of access and use. This tool should allow interested nonspecialists to gain a feel for the use of such data and greatly facilitate integration of InSAR into upper division geoscience courses, giving students practice in comparing actual data to modeled results. The tool, provisionally named 'Visible Earthquakes', uses web-based technologies to instantly render the displacement field that would be observable using InSAR for a given fault location, geometry, orientation, and slip. The user can adjust these 'source parameters' using a simple, clickable interface, and see how these affect the resulting model interferogram. By visually matching the model interferogram to a real earthquake interferogram (processed separately and included in the web tool) a user can produce their own estimates of the earthquake's source parameters. Once satisfied with the fit of their models, users can submit their results and see how they compare with the distribution of all other contributed earthquake models, as well as the mean and median models. We envisage that the ensemble of contributed models will be useful both as a research resource and in the classroom. Locations of earthquakes derived from InSAR data have already been demonstrated to differ significantly from those obtained from global seismic networks (Weston et al., 2011), and the locations obtained by our users will enable us to identify systematic mislocations that are likely due to errors in Earth velocity models used to locate earthquakes. If the tool is incorporated into geophysics, tectonics and/or structural geology classes, in addition to familiarizing students with InSAR and elastic deformation modeling, the spread of different results for each individual earthquake will allow the teaching of concepts such as model uncertainty and non-uniqueness when modeling real scientific data. Additionally, the process students go through to optimize their estimates of fault parameters can easily be tied into teaching about the concepts of forward and inverse problems, which are common in geophysics.},

abstract = {SummaryHydraulic fracturing is an important technique to allow mobilization of hydrocarbons in tight reservoirs. Sand or ceramic proppant is pumped into the fractured reservoir to ensure fractures remain open and permeable after the hydraulic treatment. As such, the distribution of proppant is a controlling factor on where the reservoir is permeable and can be effectively drained. Methods to monitor the fracturing process, such as tiltmeters or microseismic, are not sensitive to proppant distributions in the subsurface after the fracturing treatment is complete (Cipolla and Wright, 2000).An electrically conductive proppant could create a significant physical property contrast between the propped region of the reservoir and the host rock. Electromagnetic geophysical methods can be used to image this property (Heagy and Oldenburg, 2013). However, traditional geophysical inversions are poorly constrained, requiring a-priori information to be incorporated through known electrical properties. We examine a strategy to invert directly for the proppant volume using a parametrization of electrical conductivity in terms of proppant distribution within the reservoir.},

abstract = {Electromagnetics has an important role to play in solving the next generation of geoscience problems. These problems are multidisciplinary, complex, and require collaboration. This is especially true at the base scientific level, where the underlying physical equations need to be solved, and data, associated with physical experiments, need to be inverted. In this paper, we present arguments for adopting an open-source methodology for geophysics and provide some background about open-source software for electromagnetics. Immediate benefits are the reduced time required to carry out research, being able to collaborate, having reproducible results, and being able to disseminate results quickly. To illustrate the use of an open-source methodology in electromagnetics, we present two challenges. The first is to simulate data from a time-domain airborne system over a conductive plate buried in a more resistive earth. The second is to jointly invert airborne time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) and frequency-domain electromagnetic (FDEM) data with ground TDEM. SimPEG (Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics, https://simpeg.xyz) is used for the open-source software. The figures in this paper can be reproduced by downloading the Jupyter notebooks we provide with this paper (https://github.com/simpeg-research/oldenburg-2018-AEM). Access to the source code allows the researcher to explore simulations and inversions by changing model and inversion parameters, plot fields and fluxes to gain further insight on the electromagnetic phenomena, and solve a new research problem by using open-source software as a base. By providing results in a manner that allows others to reproduce, further explore, and even extend them, we hope to demonstrate that an open-source paradigm has the potential to enable more rapid progress in the geophysics community as a whole.},

This is particularly true when working with data sets where it may not even be clear how to plot the data: 3D direct current resistivity and induced polarization surveys (it is not necessarily clear how to organize data into a pseudosection) or multicomponent data, such as electromagnetic data (we can measure three spatial components of electric and/or magnetic fields through time over a range of frequencies). Inversion is a tool for translating these data into a model we can interpret. The goal of the inversion is to find a “model” — some description of the earth's physical properties — that is consistent with both the data and geologic knowledge.},

In addition, as educators in academia, we require tools that enable students, from undergraduate to graduate level, to explore concepts.

abstract = {Fluid flow in the vadose zone is governed by Richards equation; it is parameterized by hydraulic conductivity, which is a nonlinear function of pressure head. Investigations in the vadose zone typically require characterizing distributed hydraulic properties. Saturation or pressure head data may include direct measurements made from boreholes. Increasingly, proxy measurements from hydrogeophysics are being used to supply more spatially and temporally dense data sets. Inferring hydraulic parameters from such datasets requires the ability to efficiently solve and deterministically optimize the nonlinear time domain Richards equation. This is particularly important as the number of parameters to be estimated in a vadose zone inversion continues to grow. In this paper, we describe an efficient technique to invert for distributed hydraulic properties in 1D, 2D, and 3D. Our algorithm does not store the Jacobian, but rather computes the product with a vector, which allows the size of the inversion problem to become much larger than methods such as finite difference or automatic differentiation; which are constrained by computation and memory, respectively. We show our algorithm in practice for a 3D inversion of saturated hydraulic conductivity using saturation data through time. The code to run our examples is open source and the algorithm presented allows this inversion process to run on modest computational resources.},

The forward solution to the governing partial differential equation is efficiently computed using a second-order finite volume discretization coupled with a preconditioned, biconjugate, stabilized gradient algorithm. Using the analytical solution to a potential field in a homogeneous half space, we evaluate the accuracy of our numerical forward solution and, subsequently, develop a source correction factor that reduces forward modeling errors associated with boundary effects and source electrode singularities. For the inversion algorithm we have implemented an inexact Gauss-Newton solver, with the model update being calculated using a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. The inversion uses a combination of zero and first order Tikhonov regularization. Two synthetic examples demonstrate the usefulness of this code. The first example considers a surface resistivity survey with 3813 measurements. The discretized model space contains 19,040 cells. For this example, the inversion package converges in approximately [Formula: see text] on a [Formula: see text] Pentium 4, with [Formula: see text] of RAM. The second example considers the case of borehole based data acquisition. For this example there were 4704 measurements and 13,200 model cells.

Both criteria provide a means of estimating the regularization parameter when only the relative sizes of the measurement uncertainties in a set of observations are known. The criteria, which are established components of linear inverse theory, are applied to the linearized inverse problem at each iteration in a typical iterative, linearized solution to the non-linear problem. The particular inverse problem considered here is the simultaneous inversion of electromagnetic loop–loop data for 1-D models of both electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility. The performance of each criteria is illustrated with inversions of a variety of synthetic and field data sets. In the great majority of examples tested, both criteria successfully determined suitable values of the regularization parameter, and hence credible models of the subsurface. },

@article{Haber2014,
abstract = {Airborne time-domain electromagnetic surveys are effective tools for mineral exploration and geologic mapping. 3D inversion of airborne electromagnetic data is a challenging computational problem. The size of the surveys and the spatial resolution required to adequately discretize the transmitters and receivers results in very large meshes. Solving the forward problem repeatedly on such a mesh can quickly become impractical. Fortunately, using a single mesh for both the forward and inverse problem for all of the transmitters is not necessary. The forward problem for a single source or a small group of sources can be solved on different meshes, each of which only needs to be locally refined close to the selected transmitters and receivers. Away from the selected transmitters and receivers, the mesh can be coarsened. The forward problem can then be broken into a number of highly parallel problems. Each forward modelling mesh is optimized specifically to the selected transmitters and receivers and has far fewer cells than the fine inversion mesh. Further efficiency can be gained by using stochastic Gauss–Newton methods where a stochastic approximation to the gradient, Hessian or both are used. In this paper, we present new algorithms for airborne data inversion and their implementation using a finite volume discretization on OcTree meshes. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale synthetic versatile time-domain electromagnetic surveying data set.},

abstract = {Large scale parameter estimation problems are among some of the most computationally demanding problems in numerical analysis. An academic researcher's domain-specific knowledge often precludes that of software design, which results in inversion frameworks that are technically correct, but not scalable to realistically-sized problems. On the other hand, the computational demands for realistic problems result in industrial codebases that are geared solely for high performance, rather than comprehensibility or flexibility. We propose a new software design for inverse problems constrained by partial differential equations that bridges the gap between these two seemingly disparate worlds. A hierarchical and modular design allows a user to delve into as much detail as she desires, while exploiting high performance primitives at the lower levels. Our code has the added benefit of actually reflecting the underlying mathematics of the problem, which lowers the cognitive load on user using it and reduces the initial startup period before a researcher can be fully productive. We also introduce a new preconditioner for the 3D Helmholtz equation that is suitable for fault-tolerant distributed systems. Numerical experiments on a variety of 2D and 3D test problems demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on scaling algorithms from small to large scale problems with minimal code changes.},

abstract = {Estimating parameters of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) from noisy and indirect measurements requires solutions of ill-posed inverse problems. Such problems arise in a variety of applications such as geophysical, medical imaging, and nondestructive testing. These so called parameter estimation or inverse medium problems, are computationally intense since the underlying PDEs need to be solved numerous times until the reconstruction of the parameters is sufficiently accurate. Typically, the computational demand grows significantly when more measurements are available, which poses severe challenges to inversion algorithms as measurement devices become more powerful. In this paper we present jInv, a flexible framework and open source software that provides parallel algorithms for solving parameter estimation problems with many measurements. Being written in the expressive programing language Julia, jInv is portable, easy to understand and extend, cross-platform tested, and well-documented. It provides parallelization schemes that exploit the inherent structure in many parameter estimation problems and can be used to solve multiphysics inversion problems as is demonstrated using numerical experiments motivated by geophysical imaging.},

abstract = {Active, large volume, silicic magma systems are potentially the most hazardous form of volcanism on Earth. Knowledge of the location, size, and physical properties of silicic magma reservoirs, is therefore important for providing context in which to accurately interpret monitoring data and make informed hazard assessments. Accordingly, we present the first geophysical image of the Laguna del Maule volcanic field magmatic system, using a novel 3D inversion of gravity data constrained by thermodynamic modelling. The joint analysis of gravity and thermodynamic data allows for a rich interpretation of the magma system, and highlights the importance of considering the full thermodynamic effects on melt density, when interpreting gravity models of active magmatic systems. We image a 30 km3, low density, volatile rich magma reservoir, at around 2 km depth, containing at least 85{\%} melt, hosted within a broader 115 km3 body interpreted as wholly or partially crystallised ({\textgreater}70{\%} crystal) cumulate mush. Our model suggests a magmatic system with shallow, crystal poor magma, overlying deeper, crystal rich magma. Even though a large density contrast (???600 kg/m3) with the surrounding crust exists, the lithostatic load is 50{\%} greater than the magma buoyancy force, suggesting buoyancy alone is insufficient to trigger an eruption. The reservoir is adjacent to the inferred extension of the Troncoso fault and overlies the location of an intruding sill, driving present day deformation. The reservoir is in close proximity to the 2.0 km3 Nieblas (rln) eruption at 2???3 ka, which we calculate tapped approximately 7{\%} of the magma reservoir. However, we suggest that the present day magma system is not large enough to have fed all post-glacial eruptions, and that the location, or size of the system may have migrated or varied over time, with each eruption tapping only a small aliquot of the available magma. The presence of a shallow reservoir of volatile rich, near liquidus magma, in close proximity to regional scale faulting, has important implications for volcano monitoring and hazard mitigation.},

abstract = {Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) methods are highly efficient tools for assessing the Earth's conductivity structures in a large area at low cost. However, the configuration of AEM measurements, which typically have widely distributed transmitter-receiver pairs, makes the rigorous modelling and interpretation extremely time-consuming in 3-D. Excessive overcomputing can occur when working on a large mesh covering the entire survey area and inverting all soundings in the data set. We propose two improvements. The first is to use a locally optimized mesh for each AEM sounding for the forward modelling and calculation of sensitivity. This dedicated local mesh is small with fine cells near the sounding location and coarse cells far away in accordance with EM diffusion and the geometric decay of the signals. Once the forward problem is solved on the local meshes, the sensitivity for the inversion on the global mesh is available through quick interpolation. Using local meshes for AEM forward modelling avoids unnecessary computing on fine cells on a global mesh that are far away from the sounding location. Since local meshes are highly independent, the forward modelling can be efficiently parallelized over an array of processors. The second improvement is random and dynamic down-sampling of the soundings. Each inversion iteration only uses a random subset of the soundings, and the subset is reselected for every iteration. The number of soundings in the random subset, determined by an adaptive algorithm, is tied to the degree of model regularization. This minimizes the overcomputing caused by working with redundant soundings. Our methods are compared against conventional methods and tested with a synthetic example. We also invert a field data set that was previously considered to be too large to be practically inverted in 3-D. These examples show that our methodology can dramatically reduce the processing time of 3-D inversion to a practical level without losing resolution. Any existing modelling technique can be included into our framework of mesh decoupling and adaptive sampling to accelerate large-scale 3-D EM inversions. },

abstract = {Airborne time-domain electromagnetic surveys are effective tools for mineral exploration and geologic mapping. 3D inversion of airborne electromagnetic data is a challenging computational problem. The size of the surveys and the spatial resolution required to adequately discretize the transmitters and receivers results in very large meshes. Solving the forward problem repeatedly on such a mesh can quickly become impractical. Fortunately, using a single mesh for both the forward and inverse problem for all of the transmitters is not necessary. The forward problem for a single source or a small group of sources can be solved on different meshes, each of which only needs to be locally refined close to the selected transmitters and receivers. Away from the selected transmitters and receivers, the mesh can be coarsened. The forward problem can then be broken into a number of highly parallel problems. Each forward modelling mesh is optimized specifically to the selected transmitters and receivers and has far fewer cells than the fine inversion mesh. Further efficiency can be gained by using stochastic Gauss–Newton methods where a stochastic approximation to the gradient, Hessian or both are used. In this paper, we present new algorithms for airborne data inversion and their implementation using a finite volume discretization on OcTree meshes. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale synthetic versatile time-domain electromagnetic surveying data set.},

abstract = {We propose a methodology to generate a 3D distribution of pseudo-chargeability from airborne time domain electromagnetic data. The processing flow is as follows: (a) Apply 3D inversion to TEM data to restore a background conductivity. This might involve omitting responses that are obviously contaminated with IP signals, such as negative transients in coincident loop surveys. The recovered background conductivity is assumed to be uncontaminated by IP signals. (b) Compute the TEM response from the background conductivity and subtract it from the observations. This yields the dIP data, and reduces the EM coupling. (c) The background conductivity is likely not exactly the earth conductivity, but we assume that the major effects of this inaccuracy will lead to a large scale, smoothly varying perturbation to the dIP data. If this correct, then these can be recognized and removed. (d) The final data are linearly related to a pseudo-chargeability through a sensitivity function that is analogous to that employed in usual DC-IP ground surveys. (e) The dIP data at various time channels can be inverted individually. The pseudo-chargeability models may be useful in themselves or they may be further processed to estimate Cole-Cole, or equivalent, parameters. We demonstrate our procedure on a field data set from Mt. Milligan. In the field example, we identify chargeable targets that show no indication of negative transients in the raw data. From the images we can make inferences about the relative strength and geometries of the chargeable bodies.},

abstract = {Two automatic ways of estimating the regularization parameter in underdetermined, minimum-structure-type solutions to non-linear inverse problems are compared: the generalized cross-validation and L-curve criteria. Both criteria provide a means of estimating the regularization parameter when only the relative sizes of the measurement uncertainties in a set of observations are known. The criteria, which are established components of linear inverse theory, are applied to the linearized inverse problem at each iteration in a typical iterative, linearized solution to the non-linear problem. The particular inverse problem considered here is the simultaneous inversion of electromagnetic loop–loop data for 1-D models of both electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility. The performance of each criteria is illustrated with inversions of a variety of synthetic and field data sets. In the great majority of examples tested, both criteria successfully determined suitable values of the regularization parameter, and hence credible models of the subsurface. },

Negative transients have been recorded in both of the time domain surveys and we interpret these as arising from chargeable bodies. The kimberlite pipes are referred to as DO-27 and DO-18. We look in more detail at the transient data and apply the ATEM-IP inversion procedure to recover a 3D pseudo-chargeability distribution. Important components of the analysis involve estimating a background conductivity for the region. For DO-27 we have used a 3D parametric inversion to recover the conductivity from TEM data. The IP signal for the inversion is obtained by subtracting the time domain responses estimated by EM inversion from the observed background signal. This process also removes EM coupling noise that might be contaminating the data. The resultant IP data are inverted with a linear inverse approach using the sensitivity from the background conductivity. This yields a 3D model of pseudo-chargeability.},

Methods to monitor the fracturing process, such as tiltmeters or microseismic, are not sensitive to proppant distributions in the subsurface after the fracturing treatment is complete (Cipolla and Wright, 2000).An electrically conductive proppant could create a significant physical property contrast between the propped region of the reservoir and the host rock.

abstract = {Two automatic ways of estimating the regularization parameter in underdetermined, minimum-structure-type solutions to non-linear inverse problems are compared: the generalized cross-validation and L-curve criteria. Both criteria provide a means of estimating the regularization parameter when only the relative sizes of the measurement uncertainties in a set of observations are known. The criteria, which are established components of linear inverse theory, are applied to the linearized inverse problem at each iteration in a typical iterative, linearized solution to the non-linear problem. The particular inverse problem considered here is the simultaneous inversion of electromagnetic loop–loop data for 1-D models of both electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility. The performance of each criteria is illustrated with inversions of a variety of synthetic and field data sets. In the great majority of examples tested, both criteria successfully determined suitable values of the regularization parameter, and hence credible models of the subsurface. },

abstract = {Airborne time-domain electromagnetic surveys are effective tools for mineral exploration and geologic mapping. 3D inversion of airborne electromagnetic data is a challenging computational problem. The size of the surveys and the spatial resolution required to adequately discretize the transmitters and receivers results in very large meshes. Solving the forward problem repeatedly on such a mesh can quickly become impractical. Fortunately, using a single mesh for both the forward and inverse problem for all of the transmitters is not necessary. The forward problem for a single source or a small group of sources can be solved on different meshes, each of which only needs to be locally refined close to the selected transmitters and receivers. Away from the selected transmitters and receivers, the mesh can be coarsened. The forward problem can then be broken into a number of highly parallel problems. Each forward modelling mesh is optimized specifically to the selected transmitters and receivers and has far fewer cells than the fine inversion mesh. Further efficiency can be gained by using stochastic Gauss–Newton methods where a stochastic approximation to the gradient, Hessian or both are used. In this paper, we present new algorithms for airborne data inversion and their implementation using a finite volume discretization on OcTree meshes. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale synthetic versatile time-domain electromagnetic surveying data set.},

abstract = {We have developed an open source 3D, MATLAB based, resistivity inversion package. The forward solution to the governing partial differential equation is efficiently computed using a second-order finite volume discretization coupled with a preconditioned, biconjugate, stabilized gradient algorithm. Using the analytical solution to a potential field in a homogeneous half space, we evaluate the accuracy of our numerical forward solution and, subsequently, develop a source correction factor that reduces forward modeling errors associated with boundary effects and source electrode singularities. For the inversion algorithm we have implemented an inexact Gauss-Newton solver, with the model update being calculated using a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. The inversion uses a combination of zero and first order Tikhonov regularization. Two synthetic examples demonstrate the usefulness of this code. The first example considers a surface resistivity survey with 3813 measurements. The discretized model space contains 19,040 cells. For this example, the inversion package converges in approximately [Formula: see text] on a [Formula: see text] Pentium 4, with [Formula: see text] of RAM. The second example considers the case of borehole based data acquisition. For this example there were 4704 measurements and 13,200 model cells. The inversion for this example requires [Formula: see text] of computational time.},

abstract = {Traditionally 4D seismic methods are used to image the flow of an injected fluid within a reservoir for the purpose of enhanced oil recovery or CO2 sequestration. However, this method does not provide direct information about changes in material properties and is typically difficult and expensive to repeat accurately. Since the electrical properties of a porous media depend on saturation, it is possible to use electromagnetic (EM) geophysical methods for time-lapse monitoring as the saturation will change during fluid injection. As a consequence of the ill-posedness of the nonlinear EM inverse problem there is no unique solution, and so other information must be incorporated through regularization in order to recover a reasonable solution. As the changes in electrical conductivity depend on changes in saturation, a two-phase flow simulation is used to compute reference saturation models for the regularization, where Archie's law provides a relation between conductivity and saturation. We find the use of multiphysics to constrain the EM inversion produces model estimates that better represent the physics of the flow.},

abstract = {The process of seawater intrusions into freshwater aquifers occurs naturally, but also as a result of increased groundwater extraction. Different types of models to capture this complex process involving density driven flow and variable boundary conditions have already been proposed and implemented. However, many fewer studies were done in groundwater management planning, for example how to adjust the future groundwater extraction or injection rates with respect to saltwater intrusions occurrence. Geophysical methods (e.g. DC resistivity) offer a good alternative to standard hydrological measurement techniques which need to deal with the miscibility of both freshwater and saltwater and only scarce observation points. The resistivity survey can provide 3D data at lower cost, however the precision depends on the reference models and often decreases with depth. Therefore we suggest an optimization framework which links the hydrogeological model with geophysical datasets. The dynamics of the system is represented by a 3D model for transient groundwater flow in a confined aquifer based on discretized flow and solute mass balance equations. To overcome the difficulty of coupled nonlinear governing equations a semi - Lagrangian method is implemented for the transport equation. This enables to choose arbitrarily large time step without losing stability. For the geophysical forward and inverse problem RESINVM3D package is used. Once the coupled optimization framework is used for many time steps it leads to an optimal control problem. Kalman filtering techniques are often used for such problems, after each time step the optimal state estimates are found based on the system dynamics and observations which are in this case provided by geophysical data. For the variable density flow the process dynamic is nonlinear, in such cases the KF state estimates derivation assumes that the deviation from linearity is of a first order. For the seawater intrusions, where the concentration gradients are small, this assumption is correct.},

abstract = {Bayesian inverse modeling techniques are computationally expensive because many forward simulations are needed when sampling the posterior distribution of the parameters. In this paper, we combine the implicit sampling method and generalized polynomial chaos expansion (gPCE) to significantly reduce the computational cost of performing Bayesian inverse modeling. There are three steps in this approach: (1) find the maximizer of the likelihood function using deterministic approaches; (2) construct a gPCE-based surrogate model using the results from a limited number of forward simulations; and (3) efficiently sample the posterior distribution of the parameters using implicit sampling method. The cost of constructing the gPCE-based surrogate model is further decreased by using sparse Bayesian learning to reduce the number of gPCE coefficients that have to be determined. We demonstrate the approach for a synthetic ponded infiltration experiment simulated with TOUGH2. The surrogate model is highly accurate with mean relative error that is {\textless}0.035{\%} in predicting saturation and {\textless}0.25{\%} in predicting the likelihood function. The posterior distribution of the parameters obtained using our proposed technique is nearly indistinguishable from the results obtained from either an implicit sampling method or a Markov chain Monte Carlo method utilizing the full model.},

@article{Herckenrath2012,
abstract = {Salt water intrusion models are commonly used to support groundwater resource management in coastal aquifers. Concentration data used for model calibration are often sparse and limited in spatial extent. With airborne and ground-based electromagnetic surveys, electrical resistivity models can be obtained to provide high-resolution three-dimensional models of subsurface resistivity variations that can be related to geology and salt concentrations on a regional scale. Several previous studies have calibrated salt water intrusion models with geophysical data, but are typically limited to the use of the inverted electrical resistivity models without considering the measured geophysical data directly. This induces a number of errors related to inconsistent scales between the geophysical and hydrologic models and the applied regularization constraints in the geophysical inversion. To overcome these errors, we perform a coupled hydrogeophysical inversion (CHI) in which we use a salt water intrusion model to interpret the geophysical data and guide the geophysical inversion. We refer to this methodology as a Coupled Hydrogeophysical Inversion-State (CHI-S), in which simulated salt concentrations are transformed to an electrical resistivity model, after which a geophysical forward response is calculated and compared with the measured geophysical data. This approach was applied for a field site in Santa Cruz County, California, where a time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) dataset was collected. For this location, a simple two-dimensional cross-sectional salt water intrusion model was developed, for which we estimated five uniform aquifer properties, incorporating the porosity that was also part of the employed petrophysical relationship. In addition, one geophysical parameter was estimated. The six parameters could be resolved well by fitting more than 300 apparent resistivities that were comprised by the TDEM dataset. Except for three sounding locations, all the TDEM data could be fitted close to a root-mean-square error of 1. Possible explanations for the poor fit of these soundings are the assumption of spatial uniformity, fixed boundary conditions and the neglecting of 3D effects in the groundwater model and the TDEM forward responses.},

Our previously developed discrete adjoint version of OpenFOAM allows us to calculate derivatives of arbitrary objectives with respect to a potentially very large number of input parameters at a relative (to a single primal flow simulation) computational cost which is independent of that number. Discrete adjoint OpenFOAM enables us to run gradientbased methods such as topology optimization efficiently. Up until recently only a serial version was available limiting both the computing performance and the amount of memory available for the solution of the problem. In this paper we describe a first parallel version of discrete adjoint OpenFOAM based on our adjoint MPI library.},

@article{Klein2017,
abstract = {In the geostatistical inverse problem of subsurface hydrology, continuous hydraulic parameter fields, in most cases hydraulic conductivity, are estimated from measurements of dependent variables, such as hydraulic heads, under the assumption that the parameter fields are autocorrelated random space functions. Upon discretization, the continuous fields become large parameter vectors with (104−107) elements. While cokriging-like inversion methods have been shown to be efficient for highly resolved parameter fields when the number of measurements is small, they require the calculation of the sensitivity of each measurement with respect to all parameters, which may become prohibitive with large sets of measured data such as those arising from transient groundwater flow. We present a Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method for the geostatistical inverse problem, in which a single adjoint equation needs to be solved to obtain the gradient of the objective function. Using the autocovariance matrix of the parameters as preconditioning matrix, expensive multiplications with its inverse can be avoided, and the number of iterations is significantly reduced. We use a randomized spectral decomposition of the posterior covariance matrix of the parameters to perform a linearized uncertainty quantification of the parameter estimate. The feasibility of the method is tested by virtual examples of head observations in steady-state and transient groundwater flow. These synthetic tests demonstrate that transient data can reduce both parameter uncertainty and time spent conducting experiments, while the presented methods are able to handle the resulting large number of measurements.},

The most valuable linearization schemes for Richards` equation, i.e. the Newtonmethod, the Picard method, the Picard/Newton method and theLscheme are presented and theirperformance is comparatively studied. The convergence, the computational time and the conditionnumbers for the underlying linear systems are recorded. The convergence of theLscheme is theo-retically proved and the convergence of the other methods is discussed. A new scheme is proposed,theLscheme/Newton method which is more robust and quadratically convergent. The linearizationmethods are tested on illustrative numerical examples.},

abstract = {The flow of liquids in unsaturated porous mediums follows the ordinary laws of hydrodynamics, the motion being produced by gravity and the pressure gradient force acting in the liquid. By making use of Darcey's law, that flow is proportional to the forces producing flow, the equation K2 +K +gK/z = sA /t may be derived for the capillary conduction of liquids in porous mediums. It is possible experimentally to determine the capillary potential =dp/ , the capillary conductivity K, which is defined by the flow equation q=K(g ), and the capillary capacity A, which is the rate of change of the liquid content of the medium with respect to . These variables are analogous, respectively, to the temperature, thermal conductivity, and thermal capacity in the case of heat flow. Data are presented and application of the equations is made for the capillary conduction of water through soil and clay but the mathematical formulations and the experimental methods developed may be used to express capillary flow for other liquids and mediums. The possible existance of a hysteresis effect between the capillary potential and moisture content of a porous medium is considered.},

The spatial and$\backslash$ntemporal evolution of wetting patterns in the soil material indicated$\backslash$nattainment of a stationary fully saturated profile in a slope region$\backslash$nunderlain by shallow sandstone bedrock.

This is demonstrated using cross-borehole radar and resistivity measurements collected during a controlled vadose zone tracer test, performed at a field site in the UK Sherwood Sandstone. Both methods show clearly the vertical migration of the tracer over a 200h monitoring period. By comparing first and second spatial moments of changes in moisture content predicted from a numerical simulation of vadose zone flow with equivalent statistics from two- and three-dimensional ERT and cross-borehole radar profiles the effective hydraulic conductivity is estimated to be approximately 0.4m/d. Such a value is comparable to field estimates from borehole hydraulic tests carried out in the saturated zone at the field site and provides valuable information that may be utilised to parameterise pollutant transport models of the site.},

@article{Pidlisecky2011,
abstract = {Difference geophysical tomography (e. g. radar, resistivity and seismic) is used increasingly for imaging fluid flow and mass transport associated with natural and engineered hydrologic phenomena, including tracer experiments, in situ remediation and aquifer storage and recovery. Tomographic data are collected over time, inverted and differenced against a background image to produce 'snapshots' revealing changes to the system; these snapshots readily provide qualitative information on the location and morphology of plumes of injected tracer, remedial amendment or stored water. In principle, geometric moments (i.e. total mass, centres of mass, spread, etc.) calculated from difference tomograms can provide further quantitative insight into the rates of advection, dispersion and mass transfer; however, recent work has shown that moments calculated from tomograms are commonly biased, as they are strongly affected by the subjective choice of regularization criteria. Conventional approaches to regularization (Tikhonov) and parametrization (image pixels) result in tomograms which are subject to artefacts such as smearing or pixel estimates taking on the sign opposite to that expected for the plume under study. Here, we demonstrate a novel parametrization for imaging plumes associated with hydrologic phenomena. Capitalizing on the mathematical analogy between moment-based descriptors of plumes and the moment-based parameters of probability distributions, we design an inverse problem that (1) is overdetermined and computationally efficient because the image is described by only a few parameters, (2) produces tomograms consistent with expected plume behaviour (e. g. changes of one sign relative to the background image), (3) yields parameter estimates that are readily interpreted for plume morphology and offer direct insight into hydrologic processes and (4) requires comparatively few data to achieve reasonable model estimates. We demonstrate the approach in a series of numerical examples based on straight-ray difference-attenuation radar monitoring of the transport of an ionic tracer, and show that the methodology outlined here is particularly effective when limited data are available.},

@article{Linde2015,
abstract = {Scientific curiosity, exploration of georesources and environmental concerns are pushing the geoscientific research community toward subsurface investigations of ever-increasing complexity. This review explores various approaches to formulate and solve inverse problems in ways that effectively integrate geological concepts with geophysical and hydrogeological data. Modern geostatistical simulation algorithms can produce multiple subsurface realizations that are in agreement with conceptual geological models and statistical rock physics can be used to map these realizations into physical properties that are sensed by the geophysical or hydrogeological data. The inverse problem consists of finding one or an ensemble of such subsurface realizations that are in agreement with the data. The most general inversion frameworks are presently often computationally intractable when applied to large-scale problems and it is necessary to better understand the implications of simplifying (1) the conceptual geological model (e.g., using model compression); (2) the physical forward problem (e.g., using proxy models); and (3) the algorithm used to solve the inverse problem (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo or local optimization methods) to reach practical and robust solutions given today's computer resources and knowledge. We also highlight the need to not only use geophysical and hydrogeological data for parameter estimation purposes, but also to use them to falsify or corroborate alternative geological scenarios.},

The methods are based on solving Riemann problems and applying limiter functions to the resulting waves, which are then propagated in a multidimensional manner. For nonlinear systems of conservation laws the methods are conservative and yield good shock resolution. The methods are generalized to hyperbolic systems that are not in conservation form and to problems that include a “capacity function.” Several examples are included for gas dynamics, acoustics in a heterogeneous medium, and advection in a stratified flow on curvilinear grids. The software packageCLAWPACKimplements these algorithms in Fortran and is freely available on the Web. One and two space dimensions are discussed here, although the algorithms and software have also been extended to three dimensions.},

abstract = {SUNDIALS is a suite of advanced computational codes for solving large-scale problems that can be modeled as a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, or as initial-value problems in ordinary differential or differential-algebraic equations. The basic versions of these codes are called KINSOL, CVODE, and IDA, respectively. The codes are written in ANSI standard C and are suitable for either serial or parallel machine environments. Common and notable features of these codes include inexact Newton-Krylov methods for solving large-scale nonlinear systems; linear multistep methods for time-dependent problems; a highly modular structure to allow incorporation of different preconditioning and/or linear solver methods; and clear interfaces allowing for users to provide their own data structures underneath the solvers. We describe the current capabilities of the codes, along with some of the algorithms and heuristics used to achieve efficiency and robustness. We also describe how the codes stem from previous and widely used Fortran 77 solvers, and how the codes have been augmented with forward and adjoint methods for carrying out first-order sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameters or initial conditions.},

@article{jinv,
abstract = {Estimating parameters of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) from noisy and indirect measurements requires solutions of ill-posed inverse problems. Such problems arise in a variety of applications such as geophysical, medical imaging, and nondestructive testing. These so called parameter estimation or inverse medium problems, are computationally intense since the underlying PDEs need to be solved numerous times until the reconstruction of the parameters is sufficiently accurate. Typically, the computational demand grows significantly when more measurements are available, which poses severe challenges to inversion algorithms as measurement devices become more powerful. In this paper we present jInv, a flexible framework and open source software that provides parallel algorithms for solving parameter estimation problems with many measurements. Being written in the expressive programing language Julia, jInv is portable, easy to understand and extend, cross-platform tested, and well-documented. It provides parallelization schemes that exploit the inherent structure in many parameter estimation problems and can be used to solve multiphysics inversion problems as is demonstrated using numerical experiments motivated by geophysical imaging.},

abstract = {Supernode partitioning for unsymmetric matrices together with complete block diagonal supernode pivoting and asynchronous computation can achieve high gigaflop rates for parallel sparse LU factorization on shared memory parallel computers. The progress in weighted graph matching algorithms helps to extend these concepts further and unsymmetric prepermutation of rows is used to place large matrix entries on the diagonal. Complete block diagonal supernode pivoting allows dynamical interchanges of columns and rows during the factorization process. The level-3 BLAS efficiency is retained and an advanced two-level left-right looking scheduling scheme results in good speedup on SMP machines. These algorithms have been integrated into the recent unsymmetric version of the PARDISO solver. Experiments demonstrate that a wide set of unsymmetric linear systems can be solved and high performance is consistently achieved for large sparse unsymmetric matrices from real world applications. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Fensel1997,
abstract = {In recent years two main technologies for knowledge sharing and reuse have emerged: ontologies and problem solving methods (PSMs). Ontologies specify reusable conceptualizations which can be shared by multiple reasoning components communicating during a problem solving process. PSMs describe in a domain-independent way the generic reasoning steps and knowledge types needed to perform a task. Typically PSMs are specified in a task-specific fashion, using modelling frameworks which describe their control and inference structures as well as their knowledge requirements and competence. In this paper we discuss a novel approach to PSM specification, which is based on the use of formal ontologies. In particular our specifications abstract from control, data flow and other dynamic aspects of PSMs to focus on the logical theory associated with a PSM (method ontology). This approach concentrates on the competence and knowledge requirements of a PSM, rather than internal control details, thus enabling black-box-style reuse. In the paper we also look at the nature of PSM specifications and we show that these can be characterised in a task-independent style as generic search strategies. The resulting 'modelling gap' between method- independent task specifications and task-independent method ontologies can be bridged by constructing the relevant adapter ontology, which reformulates the method ontology in task-specific terms. An important aspect of the ontology- centred approach described here is that, in contrast with other characterisations of task-independent PSMs, it does away with the simple, binary distinction between weak and strong methods. We argue that any method can be defined in either task-independent or task-dependent style and therefore such distinction is of limited utility in PSM reuse. The differences between PSMs which affect reuse concern the ontological commitments which they make with respect to domain knowledge and goal specifications.},

The basic idea is to create a set of Java interfaces and classes from an OWL ontology such that an instance of a Java class represents an instance of a single class of the ontology with most of its properties, class-relationships and restrictiondefinitions maintained. We note that there exist some fundamental semantic differences between Description Logic (DL) and Object Oriented (OO) systems, primarily related to completeness and satisfiability. We present various ways in which we aim to minimize the impact of such differences and show how to map a large part of the much richer OWL semantics into Java. Finally, we sketch the HarmonIA framework, which is used for the automatic generation of agent systems from institution specifications, and whose OWL Ontology Creation module was the basis for the tool presented in this paper.},

abstract = {We have developed an open source 3D, MATLAB based, resistivity inversion package. The forward solution to the governing partial differential equation is efficiently computed using a second-order finite volume discretization coupled with a preconditioned, biconjugate, stabilized gradient algorithm. Using the analytical solution to a potential field in a homogeneous half space, we evaluate the accuracy of our numerical forward solution and, subsequently, develop a source correction factor that reduces forward modeling errors associated with boundary effects and source electrode singularities. For the inversion algorithm we have implemented an inexact Gauss-Newton solver, with the model update being calculated using a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. The inversion uses a combination of zero and first order Tikhonov regularization. Two synthetic examples demonstrate the usefulness of this code. The first example considers a surface resistivity survey with 3813 measurements. The discretized model space contains 19,040 cells. For this example, the inversion package converges in approximately [Formula: see text] on a [Formula: see text] Pentium 4, with [Formula: see text] of RAM. The second example considers the case of borehole based data acquisition. For this example there were 4704 measurements and 13,200 model cells. The inversion for this example requires [Formula: see text] of computational time.},

abstract = {Rock physics attempts to relate the geophysical response of a rock to geologic properties of interest, such as porosity, lithology, and fluid content. The geophysical properties estimated by field-scale surveys, however, are impacted by additional factors, such as complex averaging of heterogeneity at the scale of the survey and artifacts introduced through data inversion, that are not addressed by traditional approaches to rock physics. We account for these field-scale factors by creating numerical analogs to geophysical surveys via Monte Carlo simulation. The analogs are used to develop field-scale rock physics relationships that are appropriate for transforming the geophysical properties estimated from a survey into geologic properties. We demonstrate the technique using a synthetic example where radar tomography is used to estimate water content.},

@article{Racz2011,
abstract = {Natural groundwater recharge is inherently difficult to quantify and predict, largely because it comprises a series of processes that are spatially distributed and temporally variable. Infiltration ponds used for managed aquifer recharge (MAR) provide an opportunity to quantify recharge processes across multiple scales under semi-controlled conditions. We instrumented a 3-ha MAR infiltration pond to measure and compare infiltration patterns determined using whole-pond and point-specific methods. Whole-pond infiltration was determined by closing a transient water budget (accounting for inputs, outputs, and changes in storage), whereas point-specific infiltration rates were determined using heat as a tracer and time series analysis at eight locations in the base of the pond. Whole-pond infiltration, normalized for wetted area, rose rapidly to more than 1.0 m/d at the start of MAR operations (increasing as pond stage rose), was sustained at high rates for the next 40 d, and then decreased to less than 0.1 m/d by the end of the recharge season. Point-specific infiltration rates indicated high spatial and temporal variability, with the mean of measured values generally being lower than rates indicated by whole-pond calculations. Colocated measurements of head gradients within saturated soils below the pond were combined with infiltration rates to calculate soil hydraulic conductivity. Observations indicate a brief period of increasing saturated hydraulic conductivity, followed by a decrease of one to two orders of magnitude during the next 50 to 75 d. Locations indicating the most rapid infiltration shifted laterally during MAR operation, and we suggest that infiltration may function as a "variable source area" processes, conceptually similar to catchment runoff.},

@article{Jin2009,
abstract = {We develop and compare two formulations of the random-walk method, grain-based and voxel-based, to simulate the nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) response of fluids contained in various models of porous media. The grain-based approach uses a spherical grain pack as input, where the solid surface is analytically defined without an approximation. In the voxel-based approach, the input is a computer-tomography or computer-generated image of reconstructed porous media. Implementation of the two approaches is largely the same, except for the representation of porous media. For comparison, both approaches are applied to various analytical and digitized models of porous media: isolated spherical pore, simple cubic packing of spheres, and random packings of monodisperse and polydisperse spheres. We find that spin magnetization decays much faster in the digitized models than in their analytical counterparts. The difference in decay rate relates to the overestimation of surface area due to the discretization of the sample; it cannot be eliminated even if the voxel size decreases. However, once considering the effect of surface-area increase in the simulation of surface relaxation, good quantitative agreement is found between the two approaches. Different grain or pore shapes entail different rates of increase of surface area, whereupon we emphasize that the value of the "surface-area-corrected" coefficient may not be universal. Using an example of X-ray-CT image of Fontainebleau rock sample, we show that voxel size has a significant effect on the calculated surface area and, therefore, on the numerically simulated magnetization response.},

abstract = {Matrix diffusion is an important transport process in geologic materials of low hydraulic conductivity. For predicting the fate and transport of contaminants, a detailed understanding of the diffusion processes in natural porous media is essential. In this study, diffusive tracer transport (iodide) was investigated in a variety of geologically different limestone and sandstone rocks. Porosity, structural and mineralogical composition, hydraulic conductivity, and other rock properties were determined. The effective diffusion coefficients were measured using the time-lag method. The results of the diffusion experiments indicate that there is a close relationship between total porosity and the effective diffusion coefficient of a rock (analogous to Archie's Law). Consequently, the tortousity factor can be expressed as a function of total porosity. The relationship fits best for thicker samples ({\textgreater} 1.0 cm) with high porosities ({\textgreater} 20{\%}), because of the reduced influence of heterogeneity in larger samples. In general, these correlations appear to be a simple way to determine tortuosity and the effective diffusion coefficient from easy to determine rock porosity values.},

abstract = {We quantify relations between rates of in situ denitrification and saturated infiltration through shallow, sandy soils during managed groundwater recharge. We used thermal methods to determine time series of point-specific flow rates, and chemical and isotopic methods to assess denitrification progress. Zero order denitrification rates between 3 and 300 $\mu$mol L(-1) d(-1) were measured during infiltration. Denitrification was not detected at times and locations where the infiltration rate exceeded a threshold of 0.7 ± 0.2 m d(-1). Pore water profiles of oxygen and nitrate concentration indicated a deepening of the redoxocline at high flow rates, which reduced the thickness of the zone favorable for denitrification. Denitrification rates were positively correlated with infiltration rates below the infiltration threshold, suggesting that for a given set of sediment characteristics, there is an optimal infiltration rate for achieving maximum nitrate load reduction and improvements to water supply during managed groundwater recharge. The extent to which results from this study may be extended to other managed and natural hydrologic settings remains to be determined, but the approach taken in this study should be broadly applicable, and provides a quantitative link between shallow hydrologic and biogeochemical processes.},

abstract = {Various ongoing researches are there on topics like which model will give more compatible results with that of observed discharges. It was argued that even complex modeling does not provide better results. Climate change and soil heterogeneity has got an important role in finding out surface runoff. In this paper, we are going to discuss briefly about variable infiltration capacity model (VIC), TOPMODEL, HBV, MIKESHE and soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model. VIC performs well in moist areas and can be efficiently used in the water management for agricultural purposes. Requirement of large data and physical parameters makes the use of MIKE SHE model limited to smaller catchments.

abstract = {Despite significant recent developments in computational power and distributed hydrologic modeling, the issue of how to adequately address the uncertainty associated with hydrological predictions remains a critical and challenging one. This issue needs to be properly addressed for hydrological modeling to realize its maximum practical potential in environmental decision-making processes. Arguably, the key to properly addressing hydrologic uncertainty is to understand, quantify, and reduce uncertainty involved in hydrologic modeling in a cohesive, systematic manner. Although general principles and techniques on addressing hydrologic uncertainty are emerging in the literature, there exist no well-accepted guidelines about how to actually implement these principles and techniques in various hydrologic settings in an integrated manner. This paper reviews, in relevant detail, the common data assimilation methods that have been used in hydrologic modeling to address problems of state estimation, parameter estimation, and system identification. In particular, the paper discusses concepts, methods, and issues involved in hydrologic data assimilation from a systems perspective. An integrated hierarchical framework is proposed for pursuing hydrologic data assimilation in several progressive steps to maximally reduce uncertainty in hydrologic predictions.},

abstract = {Special hydrogeophysics issues published by hydrology and geophysics journals, special sessions and workshops at conferences, and an increasing number of short courses demonstrate the growing interest in the use of geophysics for hydrologic investigations. The formation of the hydrogeophysics technical subcommittee of AGU's Hydrology section adds further evidence of the recognized significance of this growing interdisciplinary field. Given the clear value of nondestructive and nonintrusive imaging for subsurface investigations, we believe the advances in the adoption of existing geophysical methods, the development of novel methods, and the merging of geophysical and other data made in hydrogeophysics could be applied to a wide range of geological, environmental, and engineering applications. During the past year, a group of hydrologists, geophysicists, and applied mathematicians has been discussing how geophysics can be used more quantitatively for hydrologic studies. To promote further discussion of this idea, we propose a set of working definitions and a framework for the integration of geophysics in hydrogeologic investigations.},

@article{Harder2009,
abstract = {This contribution reviews the evolution of geological models for the DO-27 kimberlite, located in the Lac de Gras kimberlite province, Northwest Territories, Canada. The DO-27 kimberlite was discovered as a geophysical anomaly in 1992, and early models of the kimberlite (Models 1-2) were based largely on geophysical surveys, with early core drilling confirming the presence of kimberlite. Core drilling completed in 1993 was used to create the first geological model, Model 3. Model 3 interpreted the dominant pipe infill to be 'diatreme-facies' kimberlite. Influencing the interpretation of Model 3 was the understanding of kimberlites at the time, which assumed most kimberlites were comparable to southern African-style kimberlites; these kimberlites were typically large, steep-sided bodies infilled by 'diatreme-facies' kimberlite. However, this was inconsistent with the much smaller kimberlites being discovered in the early 1990s in the Lac de Gras area. Bulk sample evaluation in 1994 was conducted based on the interpretation in Model 3, targeting the 'diatreme-facies' kimberlite. The resulting diamond grades were below expectations and the project was not evaluated further. However, several partners in the project questioned the validity of Model 3 and acquired a re-assessment of the same 1993 drill cores. The resulting geological model, Model 4, interpreted 'pyroclastic kimberlite' to be the dominant pipe infill; this pipe was located south of where the 1994 evaluation was focused. The 'diatreme-facies' kimberlite of Model 3 was reinterpreted to be low-volume intrusive sills, not infilling a pipe-like body. Based on this re-interpretation, DO-27 was re-evaluated from 2005-2007 by Peregrine Diamonds Ltd. through bulk sampling and core drilling. These new data were used to create Model 5, which builds on the interpretations of Model 4. Diamond grades obtained from the 2005-2007 bulk sampling were substantially higher than those from the 1994 evaluation, which has significant implications for the economic viability of the DO-27 kimberlite. The progression in understanding and geological modeling of DO-27 demonstrates the importance of reliable and accurate geological models in the economic assessment of kimberlite pipes. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {New knowledge in science and engineering relies increasingly on results produced by scientific software. Therefore, knowing how scientists develop and use software in their research is critical to assessing the necessity for improving current development practices and to making decisions about the future allocation of resources. To that end, this paper presents the results of a survey conducted online in October-December 2008 which received almost 2000 responses. Our main conclusions are that (1) the knowledge required to develop and use scientific software is primarily acquired from peers and through self-study, rather than from formal education and training; (2) the number of scientists using supercomputers is small compared to the number using desktop or intermediate computers; (3) most scientists rely primarily on software with a large user base; (4) while many scientists believe that software testing is important, a smaller number believe they have sufficient understanding about testing concepts; and (5) that there is a tendency for scientists to rank standard software engineering concepts higher if they work in large software development projects and teams, but that there is no uniform trend of association between rank of importance of software engineering concepts and project/team size.},

@article{Aghasi2013,
abstract = {This paper presents a new joint inversion approach to shape-based inverse problems. Given two sets of data from distinct physical models, the main objective is to obtain a unified characterization of inclusions within the spatial domain of the physical properties to be reconstructed. Although our proposed method generally applies to many types of inversion problems, the main motivation here is to characterize subsurface contaminant source-zones by processing down gradient hydrological data and cross-gradient electrical resistance tomography (ERT) observations. Inspired by Newton's method for multi-objective optimization, we present an iterative inversion scheme that suggests taking descent steps that can simultaneously reduce both data-model misfit terms. Such an approach, however, requires solving a non-smooth convex problem at every iteration, which is computationally expensive for a pixel-based inversion over the whole domain. Instead, we employ a parametric level set (PaLS) technique that substantially reduces the number of underlying parameters, making the inversion computationally tractable. The performance of the technique is examined and discussed through the reconstruction of source zone architectures that are representative of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) contaminant release in a statistically homogenous sandy aquifer. In these examples, the geometric configuration of the DNAPL mass is considered along with additional information about its spatial variability within the contaminated zone, such as the identification of low and high saturation regions. Comparison of the reconstructions with the true DNAPL architectures highlights the superior performance of the model-based technique and joint inversion scheme.},

This finding implies that no further structural interpretation of geophysical parameter fields is needed, which is amajor ad- vantage compared with conventional inversions that rely on a single input data set and cooperative inversion approaches.},

abstract = {We present a 3-D joint inversion framework for seismic, magnetotelluric (MT) and scalar and tensorial gravity data. Using large-scale optimization methods, parallel forward solvers and a flexible implementation in terms of model parametrization allows us to investigate different coupling approaches for the various physical parameters involved in the joint inversion. Here we compare two different coupling approaches, direct parameter coupling where we calculate conductivities and densities from seismic slownesses and cross-gradient coupling, where each model cell has an independent value for each physical property and a structural similarity is enforced through a term in the objective function.$\backslash$nFor both types of approaches we see an improvement of the inversion results over single inversions when the inverted data sets are generated from compatible models. As expected the direct coupling approach results in a stronger interaction between the data sets and in this case better results compared to the cross-gradient coupling. In contrast, when the inverted MT data is generated from a model that violates the parameter relationship in some regions but conforms with the cross-gradient assumptions, we obtain good results with the cross-gradient approach, while the direct coupling approach results in spurious features. This makes the cross-gradient approach the first choice for regions were a direct relationship between the physical parameters is unclear.},

abstract = {Reliable prediction of subsurface fl ow and contaminant transport depends on the accuracy with which the values and spatial dis- tribution of process-relevant model parameters can be identifi ed. Successful characterization methods for complex soil systems are based on (i) an adequate parameterization of the subsurface, capable of capturing both random and structured aspects of the heterogeneous system, and (ii) site-specifi c data that are suffi ciently sensitive to the processes of interest. We present a stochastic approach in which the high-resolution imaging capability of geophysical methods is combined with the process-specifi c infor- mation obtained from the inversion of hydrological data. Geostatistical concepts are employed as a fl exible means to describe and characterize subsurface structures. The key features of the proposed approach are (i) the joint inversion of geophysical and hydrological raw data, avoiding the intermediate step of creating a (nonunique and potentially biased) tomogram of geophysical properties and (ii) the concurrent estimation of hydrological and petrophysical parameters, in addition to (iii) the determina- tion of geostatistical parameters from the joint inversion of hydrological and geophysical data. This approach is fundamentally different from inference of geostatistical parameters from an analysis of spatially distributed property data. The approach has been implemented into the iTOUGH2 inversion code and is demonstrated for the joint use of synthetic time-lapse ground penetrating radar (GPR) travel times and hydrological data collected during a simulated ponded infi ltration experiment at a highly heterogeneous site.},

@article{Linde2015,
abstract = {Scientific curiosity, exploration of georesources and environmental concerns are pushing the geoscientific research community toward subsurface investigations of ever-increasing complexity. This review explores various approaches to formulate and solve inverse problems in ways that effectively integrate geological concepts with geophysical and hydrogeological data. Modern geostatistical simulation algorithms can produce multiple subsurface realizations that are in agreement with conceptual geological models and statistical rock physics can be used to map these realizations into physical properties that are sensed by the geophysical or hydrogeological data. The inverse problem consists of finding one or an ensemble of such subsurface realizations that are in agreement with the data. The most general inversion frameworks are presently often computationally intractable when applied to large-scale problems and it is necessary to better understand the implications of simplifying (1) the conceptual geological model (e.g., using model compression); (2) the physical forward problem (e.g., using proxy models); and (3) the algorithm used to solve the inverse problem (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo or local optimization methods) to reach practical and robust solutions given today's computer resources and knowledge. We also highlight the need to not only use geophysical and hydrogeological data for parameter estimation purposes, but also to use them to falsify or corroborate alternative geological scenarios.},

The methods are based on solving Riemann problems and applying limiter functions to the resulting waves, which are then propagated in a multidimensional manner. For nonlinear systems of conservation laws the methods are conservative and yield good shock resolution. The methods are generalized to hyperbolic systems that are not in conservation form and to problems that include a “capacity function.” Several examples are included for gas dynamics, acoustics in a heterogeneous medium, and advection in a stratified flow on curvilinear grids. The software packageCLAWPACKimplements these algorithms in Fortran and is freely available on the Web.

@book{Ascher2008,
abstract = {Methods for the numerical simulation of dynamic mathematical models have been the focus of intensive research for well over 60 years, and the demand for better and more efficient methods has grown as the range of applications has increased. Mathematical models involving evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) as well as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) arise in diverse applications such as fluid flow, image processing and computer vision, physics-based animation, mechanical systems, relativity, earth sciences, and mathematical finance. This textbook develops, analyzes, and applies numerical methods for evolutionary, or time-dependent, differential problems. Both PDEs and ODEs are discussed from a unified viewpoint. The author emphasizes finite difference and finite volume methods, specifically their principled derivation, stability, accuracy, efficient implementation, and practical performance in various fields of science and engineering. Smooth and nonsmooth solutions for hyperbolic PDEs, parabolic-type PDEs, and initial value ODEs are treated, and a practical introduction to geometric integration methods is included as well. Audience: suitable for researchers and graduate students from a variety of fields including computer science, applied mathematics, physics, earth and ocean sciences, and various engineering disciplines. Researchers who simulate processes that are modeled by evolutionary differential equations will find material on the principles underlying the appropriate method to use and the pitfalls that accompany each method.

abstract = {We present scalable algorithms for parallel adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening (AMR), partitioning, and 2:1 balancing on computational domains composed of multiple connected two-dimensional quadtrees or three-dimensional octrees, referred to as a forest of octrees. By dis- tributing the union of octants from all octrees in parallel, we combine the high scalability proven previously for adaptive single-octree algorithms with the geometric flexibility that can be achieved by arbitrarily connected hexahedral macromeshes, in which each macroelement is the root of an adapted octree. A key concept of our approach is an encoding scheme of the interoctree connectivity that permits arbitrary relative orientations between octrees. Based on this encoding we develop interoctree transformations of octants. These form the basis for high-level parallel octree algorithms, which are designed to interact with an application code such as a numerical solver for partial differ- ential equations. We have implemented and tested these algorithms in the p4est software library. We demonstrate the parallel scalability of p4est on its own and in combination with two geophysics codes. Using p4est we generate and adapt multioctree meshes with up to 5.13 × 1011 octants on as many as 220,320 CPU cores and execute the 2:1 balance algorithm in less than 10 seconds per million octants per process.

@article{Alexe2014,
abstract = {This paper develops a framework for the construction and analysis of discrete adjoint sensitivities in the context of time dependent, adaptive grid, adaptive step models. Discrete adjoints are attractive in practice since they can be generated with low effort using automatic differentiation. However, this approach brings several important challenges. The space-time adjoint of the forward numerical scheme may be inconsistent with the continuous adjoint equations. A reduction in accuracy of the discrete adjoint sensitivities may appear due to the inter-grid transfer operators. Moreover, the optimization algorithm may need to accommodate state and gradient vectors whose dimensions change between iterations. This work shows that several of these potential issues can be avoided through a multi-level optimization strategy using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) hp-adaptive discretizations paired with Runge-Kutta (RK) time integration. We extend the concept of dual (adjoint) consistency to space-time RK-DG discretizations, which are then shown to be well suited for the adaptive solution of time-dependent inverse problems. Furthermore, we prove that DG mesh transfer operators on general meshes are also dual consistent. This allows the simultaneous derivation of the discrete adjoint for both the numerical solver and the mesh transfer logic with an automatic code generation mechanism such as algorithmic differentiation (AD), potentially speeding up development of large-scale simulation codes. The theoretical analysis is supported by numerical results reported for a two-dimensional non-stationary inverse problem. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The resulting image is used to determine the subsurface distribution of saltwater- and freshwater-saturated sediments and the geologic controls on fluid distributions in the region. Data acquisition took place over two field seasons in 2011 and 2012. To maximize our ability to image both vertical and horizontal variations in the subsurface, a combination of dipole-dipole, Wenner, Wenner-gamma, and gradient measurements were made, resulting in a large final dataset of approximately 139,000 data points. The resulting resistivity section extends to a depth of 150 m.b.s.l., and is used, in conjunction with the gamma logs from four coastal monitoring wells to identify four dominant lithologic units. From these data, we are able to infer the existence of a contiguous clay layer in the southern portion of our transect, which prevents downward migration of the saltwater observed in the upper 25 m of the subsurface to the underlying freshwater aquifer. The saltwater and brackish water in the northern portion of the transect introduce the potential for seawater intrusion into the hydraulically connected freshwater aquifer to the south, not just from the ocean, but also laterally from north to south.},

@article{Racz2011,
abstract = {Natural groundwater recharge is inherently difficult to quantify and predict, largely because it comprises a series of processes that are spatially distributed and temporally variable. Infiltration ponds used for managed aquifer recharge (MAR) provide an opportunity to quantify recharge processes across multiple scales under semi-controlled conditions. We instrumented a 3-ha MAR infiltration pond to measure and compare infiltration patterns determined using whole-pond and point-specific methods. Whole-pond infiltration was determined by closing a transient water budget (accounting for inputs, outputs, and changes in storage), whereas point-specific infiltration rates were determined using heat as a tracer and time series analysis at eight locations in the base of the pond. Whole-pond infiltration, normalized for wetted area, rose rapidly to more than 1.0 m/d at the start of MAR operations (increasing as pond stage rose), was sustained at high rates for the next 40 d, and then decreased to less than 0.1 m/d by the end of the recharge season. Point-specific infiltration rates indicated high spatial and temporal variability, with the mean of measured values generally being lower than rates indicated by whole-pond calculations. Colocated measurements of head gradients within saturated soils below the pond were combined with infiltration rates to calculate soil hydraulic conductivity. Observations indicate a brief period of increasing saturated hydraulic conductivity, followed by a decrease of one to two orders of magnitude during the next 50 to 75 d. Locations indicating the most rapid infiltration shifted laterally during MAR operation, and we suggest that infiltration may function as a "variable source area" processes, conceptually similar to catchment runoff.},

abstract = {Themovementof a smallplumeof fresh water through the vadose zone was monitored using surface resistiv- ity tomography and pole-pole potential measurements. Sets of potential measurements on a square grid at sev- eral times throughout the experiment show gradual, pro- gressive, and systematic development of low-resistivity zones that are inferred to be loci of fluid concentration. A procedure for inverting percentage changes in po- tentials is developed here and used to map maximum potential changes of 13{\%} into resistivity decreases of up to 40{\%} through 3-D resistivity inversion. The re- sulting patterns are complex, with both resistivity in- creases and decreases needed to match the observed data. The resistivity reductions show a spatial connec- tion to the plume's source and are suggestive of thefluid migration. Resistivity increases generally appear to form rims surrounding the decreases and may be artifacts of the inversion process. However, some iso- lated increases in the surface layer may be caused by evaporation of fluid from previous precipitation events. Interpretation of the complex patterns may limit the usefulness of this method for monitoring fluid migra- tion. Nonetheless, the resulting pattern of resistivity re- ductions may show details of fluid migration that are unavailable with more conventional monitoring tech- niques. In this experiment, comparison of the volume with reduced resistivity with the volume of injected wa- ter predicts only a 0.5{\%} increase in saturated poros- ity, demonstrating that fluid flow in the vadose zone was most likely controlled by the distribution of fine- grained clays and silts and occurred by capillary ac- tion.},
